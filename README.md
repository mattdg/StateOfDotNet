# State Of .NET
This repository contains the code for the samples referenced in Lunch and Learn on .NET - June 14 and 28th, 2023.
Slide decks also available in the [Powerpoint](/Powerpoint) folder

Each sample has a solution file to use in Visual Studio 2022, and there is also a master solution file in the root of the repo.

To run the samples, Visual Studio 2022 will need to be installed with the appropriate workloads for Web and Mobile.
